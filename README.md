# ML4HC_3Dprediction
Using Brain MRI images to predict Memory, BMI and Age

This project was done for the course Machine Learning for Healthcare at NYU in Fall 2018.

## Abstract
In recent years, a lot of research has been done
on applying deep learning to medical problems.
A significant chuck of this work focuses on using
computer vision for medical imaging tasks
like classification and segmentation. In this paper,
we use simple 3D neural network architectures
to predict parameters like memory scores, body
mass index (BMI) and age of a person. We model
the problem as both single and multitask predictions.
We compare the performance of the two
approaches. We also use visualizations to find
biomarkers for these parameters.
